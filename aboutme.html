            <br><br>
            My name's Sola Shirai (白井そら). I grew up in Japan's Aomori Prefecture, and now I'm living in
            Troy, New York as a graduate student.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working towards my PhD in Computer Science at
            Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Deborah L. MgGuinness. I am funded through
            the <a href="https://idea.rpi.edu/research/projects/heals">Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS)</a> project.
            Prior to attending RPI, I did my undergraduate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
            <br><br>
            My research interests revolve around leveraging knowledge-driven AI systems to produce new knowledge.
            In particular, my recent work has explored using KGs to perform tasks like healthy ingredient substitution
            and event prediction for cause-effect events.
            <br><br>
            A common guiding theme of my research is to utilize "context" to produce more interpretable and
            interoperable models. We intuitively have a reasonable understanding of what context
            is, but it is seldom precisely captured and represented in AI systems.
            I believe that there is great potential to
            leverage context in more meaningful ways to help make resources like knowledge graphs more effective in
            recommendation / decision making systems.
            <br><br>
            I also have a broader interest in the areas of the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs,
            Natural Language Processing, and integrating machine learning methods together with knowledge-driven methods.
