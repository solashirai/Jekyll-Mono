            My name's Sola Shirai (白井そら). I grew up in Japan's Aomori Prefecture, and now I'm living in
            Troy, New York as a graduate student.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working towards my PhD in Computer Science at
            Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Deborah L. MgGuinness. I am funded through
            the <a href="https://idea.rpi.edu/research/projects/heals">Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS)</a> project.
            Prior to attending RPI, I did my undergraduate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
            <br><br>
            My research interests revolve around leveraging knowledge-driven systems, explainable A.I.,
            and personalization. My recent work has focused on applying these ideas to diabetes healthcare, tackling
            use cases like substituting ingredients to make recipes healthier and recommending meals based on
            healthy eating guidelines.
            <br><br>
            I also have a broader interest in the areas of the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs,
            Natural Language Processing, and integrating machine learning methods together with knowledge-driven methods.
