            <br><br>
            My name's Sola Shirai (白井そら), and I'm currently working as a Research Scientist at IBM in Yorktown Heights, NY.
            This personal website is a bit out of date, and I'm thinking about what to put here in the future.
            <br><br>
            I previously received my PhD in Computer Science at
            Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Deborah L. MgGuinness.
            Prior to attending RPI, I did my undergraduate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
            I grew up in Japan's Aomori prefecture.
            <br><br>
            My research interests generally revolve around knowledge-driven AI systems.
            <br><br>
            A common guiding theme of my graduate research is to utilize "context" to produce more interpretable and
            interoperable models.
            <br><br>
            I also have a broader interest in the areas of the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs,
            Natural Language Processing, and integrating machine learning methods together with knowledge-driven methods.
