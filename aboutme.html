            <br><br>
            My name's Sola Shirai (白井そら). I grew up in Japan's Aomori Prefecture, and now I'm living in
            Troy, New York as a graduate student.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working towards my PhD in Computer Science at
            Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Deborah L. MgGuinness. I am funded through
            the <a href="https://idea.rpi.edu/research/projects/heals">Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS)</a> project.
            Prior to attending RPI, I did my undergraduate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
            <br><br>
            My research interests revolve around leveraging knowledge-driven systems, explainable A.I.,
            and personalization. My recent work has focused on applying these ideas to diabetes healthcare, tackling
            use cases like substituting ingredients to make recipes healthier and recommending meals based on
            healthy eating guidelines.
            <br><br>
            In my most recent explorations, towards nailing down my thesis topic, I've started to become invested in
            the concept of "context" in such systems. We intuitively have a reasonable understanding of what context
            is, but how is it represented and utilized in AI systems? I believe that there is great potential to
            leverage context in more meaningful ways to help make resources like knowledge graphs more effective in
            recommendation / decision making systems.
            <br><br>
            I also have a broader interest in the areas of the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs,
            Natural Language Processing, and integrating machine learning methods together with knowledge-driven methods.
