I've started a summer internship with Robert Bosch LLC, as a "knowledge base intern". I am working with
the research group at Bosch's [Sunnyvale location](https://www.bosch.us/our-company/bosch-in-the-usa/sunnyvale/),
but unfortunately I will be totally remote for the duration.

My planned internship project will be to expand on some of the work I did previously on ingredient substitutions,
but trying to have a more generalized focus (as "modifying procedural instructions" rather than limiting
it to only recipes/ingredients) and apply some more advanced methods to take my work further.
