My submission for the research track at the 2021 [International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/),
 titled "EaT-PIM: Substituting Entities in Procedural Instructions using Flow Graphs and Embeddings", was accepted.
 This paper is based on the work that I conducted during my internship at Bosch last year.
 
Content of this entry will be updated after my presentation has been conducted (expected to occur October 23-27).
