A workshop paper titled "Privacy-Preserving Annotation of Face Images through Attribute-Preserving Face Synthesis"
was accepted to the [CV-COPS](https://cvcops19.cispa.saarland/#call) workshop at the 2019 [Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition](https://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/).

This paper was based on my capstone project conducted at WPI. The motivation of my work was to explore methods
to crowdsource image labels (e.g., labeling a face as "smiling" or "frowning") while preserving the privacy of the 
image subject. My work compared two methods - converting images into 3-D renders, and generative adversarial networks -
to compare crowdsource image labeling performance.
