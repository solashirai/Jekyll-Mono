I participated in [Applied Machine Learning Days EPFL 2021](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2021)'s 
AI & food and nutrition track, and gave a presentation on my previously accepted journal paper.

As with all other events over the past year, the workshop was fully virtual, but there were many interesting
presentations about things like [nudging people towards healthier diets using social psychology](https://appliedmldays.org/highlights/326)
and [predicting eating habits using online data](https://appliedmldays.org/highlights/323).
