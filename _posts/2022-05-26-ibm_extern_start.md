I started a summer "externship" at IBM Research, through the Rensselaer-IBM AI Research Collaboration.
I'm working with Oktie Hassanzadeh and Debarun Bhattacharjya at IBM's [Thomas J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/),
in Yorktown Heights, NY.

My externship project will focus on the topic of event forecasting, leveraging open-sourced knowledge graph resources
(such as [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)) together with reasoning-based
link prediction methods. My goals for this project are to produce predictions for future events
that are contextual and consider factors such as the interestingness or surprise of the forecasts that are made.
