I participated in the [Personal Health Knowledge Graph Workshop](https://suitclub.ischool.utexas.edu/PHKG2020/index.html)
 at the 2020 [Knowledge Graph Conference](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/). I helped out as part
 of the program committee for the workshop, and I also presented a [lightning talk](https://suitclub.ischool.utexas.edu/PHKG2020/resouces/Sola_shirai.pdf).
