## Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS)

I'm currently working as part of RPI's HEALS project. My ongoing projects involve leveraging semantic information 
present in resources (like knowledge graphs) to provide actionable & explainable insights about patients.

One of my recent projects with HEALS involved substituting ingredients in recipes. We developed a system to 
automatically identify "unhealthy" ingredients based on linked nutritional information and generate plausible 
suggestions for "healthier" substitutions.
