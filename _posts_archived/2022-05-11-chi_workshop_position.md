I participated in the [Grand Challenges in Personal Informatics and AI](https://piandaichi2022.weebly.com/) workshop,
at CHI 2022, and presented on my position paper about the need for more precise use of "context" in
personal informatics applications.

While the CHI conference was conducted in a hybrid setting, this workshop was fully remote, and we primarily conducted
discussions in small breakout groups about how to address some of the key challenges in the area of personal informatics.
A listing of the accepted position papers, including a paper lead by my collaborator Dan Gruen, can be found
