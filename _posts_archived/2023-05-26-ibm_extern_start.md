I returned for another summer "externship" at IBM Research, through the Rensselaer-IBM AI Research Collaboration.
This year my goal is to explore extensions to my [previous externship work](2023-05-01-event_cbr_www.md) by incoroprating
large language models into my methods to combat the issue of data sparsity that is common in knowledge graphs.

For this externship I also am exploring methods surrounding tabular data to support use-cases surrounding data management and
prediction. This work will also explore the potential of utilizing metadata about tables to provide
additional support for various tabular-data related tasks, as well as developing a general model in which to capture
available metadata.
