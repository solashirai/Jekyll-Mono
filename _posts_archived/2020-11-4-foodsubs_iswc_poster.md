I presented a poster at the 2020 [International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/), titled 
"Semantics-Driven Ingredient Substitution in the FoodKG."

The content of this poster covers progress that I've made on some work around automatically identifying 
ingredient substitutions to improve personal health. The motivation of this work is to make the process of choosing
"healthy" ingredient substitutions easier for users. We judge healthiness based on nutritional content and 
food classification of ingredients, which is enabled by the [FoodKG](https://foodkg.github.io/).

At the time of writing, a more complete publication on the content of this presentation is under review.
